# Mapping Earthquakes

In this presentation, I used JavaScript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data to create and display a map using the d3.json() function. This map shows tectonic plates (in red outline), all earthquakes from the past week, and earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 and greater for the past week. These three layovers are displayed on three different types of base maps. The basemaps are are interchangeable with the layers and use different size and color of marks to show magnitude and position of the earthquakes. Additionally, there is a popup with text for each circle mark to describe the magnitude and location for each earthquake.
